The Ruins of Alph code by Mastermind_X released with permission under the GPLv3 licence. At it's current state it can be built using DevKitARM as a standalone ROM. However, it cannot be inserted to any Pokemon ROMs as of yet, as it requires a custom gba.specs file. Any knowledge as to how to insert it is welcome.
